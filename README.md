# CAPSTONE PROJECT : LONDON vs PARIS

## Once upon a time...

Among the best cities to visit in Europe, Paris and London are two historical cities that are well rated. It is sure that, we don't have the same criteria to state how much we like a city over an other. The reasons can be very diverse from one person to another. Something is certain, if not ,let's make it an assumption, What   people may like in a city is about how they can enjoy themselves there : food, drink, art, culture, park, nightlife and so on... 
To put in a nutshell, people may be interested in the type of activities they can have. One can relevantly wonders if London and Paris meet this expectation. We will not discuss demography data in this project.


Furthermore,as far as tourism is concerned, weather is also an important subject. The impact of weather on tourism may depends on various parameters such as precipitation, sun, temperature, most common day condition. We must also take into account that, the weather preference can differ with the kinds of activities that a tourist may pursue. Y
ou know what? Nevermind! To make it simple and less theoretical, Let's just assume that a blue sky is most appreciated than a grey one.
A most spread idea is that London has a very bad weather and it rains pretty much there. 
Anyway, for people who want to enjoy outdoors under the sun, this might not be a positive intel. Is it only a 'clich√©'?

## What are we going to discuss ?

The main problem we will discuss is whether Paris is so different of London. 
We are going to argue how similar and dissimilar London and Paris are.

## To whom it may concern

The topic may interest anyone particularly prospective tourists who want know the two cities and decide where to go for holidays for instance.

## Itinerary

To achieve our goal, our work will consist in two big parts. Firstly, we are going to explore both cities in order to discover the kind of attractions/stuffs one can enjoy in London and Paris. Then we are going to analyze and compare the weather is both cities.
